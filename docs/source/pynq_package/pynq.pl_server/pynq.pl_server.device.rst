pynq.pl_server.device Module
============================

The pynq.pl_server.device module exposes the user frontend for a device on 
a Linux system. This class, as a singleton for each device, manages
the device status by communicating with the device server. As a special case,
the **Device** extends the device class and implements its own way of memory
management.
