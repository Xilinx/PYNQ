Opening a USB Serial Terminal
=============================

If you can't access the terminal from Jupyter, you can connect the micro-USB
cable from your computer to the board and open a terminal. You can use the
terminal to check the network connection of the board. You will need to have
terminal emulator software installed on your computer. `PuTTY
<http://www.putty.org/>`_ is one application that can be used, and is available
for free on Windows. To open a terminal, you will need to know the COM port for
the board.

On Windows, you can find this in the Windows *Device Manager* in the control panel. 
   
  1. Open the Device Manager, expand the *Ports* menu
  2. Find the COM port for the *USB Serial Port*.  e.g. COM5
  3. Open PuTTY

Once PuTTY is open, enter the following settings:
    
  4. Select serial
  5. Enter the COM port number
  6. Enter the serial terminal settings (below)
  7. Click *Open*

Full terminal Settings:
    
  * 115200 baud
  * 8 data bits
  * 1 stop bit
  * No Parity
  * No Flow Control
  
Hit *Enter* in the terminal window to make sure you can see the command prompt:

.. code-block:: console
    
    xilinx@pynq:/home/xilinx#

You can then run the same commands listed above to change the hostname, or configure a proxy. 

You can also check the hostname of the board by running the *hostname* command:

.. code-block:: console
    
    hostname

You can also check the IP address of the board using *ifconfig*:

.. code-block:: console
    
    ifconfig

.. _microsd-card-setup:
