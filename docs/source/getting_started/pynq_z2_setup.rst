  1. Set the ** Boot** jumper to the *SD* position.
     (This sets the board to boot from the Micro-SD card)
   
  2. To power the board from the micro USB cable, set the **Power**
     jumper to the *USB* position. (You can also power the board from an external 12V
     power regulator by setting the jumper to *REG*.)

  3. Insert the Micro SD card loaded with the PYNQ-Z2 image into the **Micro
     SD** card slot underneath the board

  4. Connect the USB cable to your PC/Laptop, and to the **PROG - UART**
     MicroUSB port on the board

Turning On the PYNQ-Z2
----------------------

As indicated in step 6 of :ref:`pynqz2-board-setup`, slide the power switch to the *ON*
position to turn on the board. The **Red** LED will come on immediately to
confirm that the board has power.  After a few seconds, the **Yellow/Green
/ Done** LED will light up to show that the ZynqÂ® device is operational.

After a minute you should see two **Blue ** LEDs and four
**Yellow/Green** LEDs flash simultaneously. The **Blue** LEDs
will then turn on and off while the **Yellow/Green** LEDs remain on. The
system is now booted and ready for use.
