Quick Start
**************

If you have a Micro SD card preloaded with the PYNQ-Z1 image, you can follow the quick start instructions below. Otherwise go to the next section for the `full getting started with PYNQ guide <2_getting_started.html>`_ in section 3. 

Set up the board
=================

   .. image:: ./images/pynqz1_quick_start.jpg
      :align: center

1 Set the boot jumper to SD, insert the Micro SD card into the board, and connect the USB cable (Micro-B), and Ethernet cable

2 Connect the other end of Ethernet cable to your laptop or router, and the USB cable to your laptop or a powered USB port

3 Power on the board, and wait ~30s for the board to boot (The LEDs will flash, and the yellow LEDs will stay on when the board is ready)

4 Open a browser and go to `http://pynq:9090 <http://pynq:9090>`_ or  `http://192.168.2.99:9090 <http://192.168.2.99:9090>`_  (It may take some time for the network to resolve the board address.)

The Jupyter password is ``xilinx``
