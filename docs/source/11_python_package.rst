``pynq`` Package
*********************

This section describes the ``pynq`` package for the PYNQ-Z1 platform. 

After powering the board with the Micro SD card in place, the board will boot into Linux. Python3 is installed with Jupyter Notebook support. The Python package `pynq` allows users to access  overlays from Python.   

Some preinstalled features of this Linux image include:

* Networking is enabled, and the board will attempt to get an IP address from a DHCP server on the network.  If a DHCP server is not found, the board will fallback and assign itself a static IP of 192.168.2.99 by default. This default IP address can be changed. 
* Samba, a file sharing service, is enabled. This means that the linux home area can be accessed from a Windows machine by navigating to or mapping ``\\pynq\xilinx`` (Windows) or ``smb:pynq/xilinx`` (Mac/Linux) .  The samba ``username:password`` is ``xilinx:xilinx``.  Files can be copied to and from the board, and the Pynq source code, and notebooks can be accessed and modified using your preferred editors on your host PC. 
* A Jupyter Notebook server is initialized on port 9090 and automatically starts after boot.
* The base overlay is preloaded in the FPGA fabric. 


Python ``pynq`` Package Structure
==================================
All Pynq code is contained in the *pynq* Python package and is can be found on the board at /home/xilinx/pynq.  This package is derived from the Github repository and the latest version can always be installed from ``<GitHub repository>/python/pynq``.

Pynq contains four main subpackages: ``board``, ``iop``, ``drivers``, and ``bitstream``; a ``tests`` subpackage is available for testing the user subpackages.  Each of the five subpackages are described below.

To learn more about Python package structures, please refer to the `official python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/modules.html#packages>`_.



board
=====
This folder contains libraries or python packages for peripherals available on the PYNQ-Z1 board: button, switch, rgbled and led.  For example the following code will turn on one of PYNQ-Z1's LEDs:

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq.board import LED
   led = LED(0)
   led.on()


iop
=====
This folder contains libraries for the following Pmod devices ``Pmod_ADC``, ``Pmod_ALS``, ``Pmod_DAC``, `Pmod_DPOT``,  ``Pmod_LED8``, ``Pmod_OLED``, ``Pmod_PWM``,  ``Pmod_TIMER``, and ``Pmod_TMP2``.

The following Grove peripherals are also supported: ``Grove ADC``, ``Grove Buzzer``, ``Grove IMU``, ``Grove LED bar``, ``Grove Light Sensor``, ``Grove OLED``,  ``Grove PIR``,  ``Grove Temperature Sensor``. 

``Arduino_Analog``, and ``Arduino_IO`` are provided for interfacing to the arduino interface. 

In addition, ``Pmod_IO``, ``Pmod_IIC`` and ``DevMode`` are developer classes allowing direct low level access to I/O controllers.

There is also an additional module named ``_iop.py``; this module acts like a wrapper to allow all the Pmod classes to interface with the MicroBlaze inside an IOP.  The ``_IOP`` class prevents multiple device instantiations on the same Pmod at the same time. (i.e. This prevents the user assigning more devices to a port than can be physically connected.)  ``_IOP`` uses the overlay class to track each IOP's status. 

.. note:: ``_iop.py`` is an internal module, not intended to be instantiated directly use. In Python, there is no concept of _public_ and _private_; we use ``_`` as a prefix to indicate internal definitions, variables, functions, and packages.


For example, the following code will instantiate and write to the Pmod_OLED attached on PMODA.

.. code-block:: python

   from pynq import Overlay
   from pynq.iop import Pmod_OLED
   from pynq.iop.iop_const import PMODA

   ol = Overlay("base.bit")
   ol.download()

   pmod_oled = Pmod_OLED(PMODA)
   pmod_oled.clear()
   pmod_oled.write('Welcome to the\nPynq-Z1 board!')

bitstream
===========

This folder contains the base.bit and the base.tcl. The base.bit is the precompiled overlay and base.tcl provides the information of the hardware it is built from.


drivers
=========

This folder contains various classes to support audio, video, DMA, and Trace_Buffer.


tests
======

This folder includes a tests package for use with all other pynq subpackages.  All testing is done using `pytest <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_.  Please see `The Verification Section <12_verification.html>`_ to learn more about Pynq's use of pytest to do automated testing.

.. note:: The ``tests`` folders in ``board``, ``iop``, ``drivers``, and others rely on the functions implemented in the ``test`` folders of the pynq package. This common practice in Python where each subpackage has its own ``tests``.  This practice can keep the source code modular and *self-contained*.

documentation
=============================
To find documentation for each module, see the `Pynq Package <modules.html>`_ for documentation built from the actual Python source code.
