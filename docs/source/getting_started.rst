Getting Started
***************

You need a supported AMD-Xilinx platform to get started. How you get PYNQ depends
on your platform. For some Zynq|Zynq Ultrascale+ platforms you can download 
an SD card image to boot the board. For other platforms, including Alveo and Kria
SoMs, you can install PYNQ onto your host Operating System. 

If you have one of the following boards, you can follow the quick start guide.
Go to the `PYNQ support forum <https://discuss.pynq.io/>`_ for help.

Example overlays and notebooks
==============================
    
You can find a selection of PYNQ projects and notebooks on the 
`PYNQ community webpage <http://www.pynq.io/community.html>`_. These are 
projects from other PYNQ users that you can install and use on your own 
PYNQ platform (assuming the design supports your platform). 

You can also install additional overlays and notebooks using the PYNQ *command
line interface*:

Using PYNQ with other boards
============================

You can find other PYNQ enabled boards on the `PYNQ.io boards <http://www.pynq.io/board.html>`_ page. 

If you have another Xilinx-based platform you would like to use with PYNQ, see the following guide:
