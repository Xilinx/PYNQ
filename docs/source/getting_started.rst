MicroSD Card Setup
------------------

Preloaded Micro SD cards are available from Digilent. If you already have a
Micro SD card preloaded with the PYNQ-Z1 image, you can skip this step.

To make your own PYNQ Micro-SD card:

    * `Download and the PYNQ-Z1 image
      <https://files.digilent.com/Products/PYNQ/pynq_z1_image_2017_02_10.zip>`_
      and unzip
    * Write the image to a blank Micro SD card (minimum 8GB recommended)
        * Windows: Use `win32DiskImager <https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/>`_
        * Linux/MacOS: Use the built in *dd* command\*
   
\* For detailed instructions for writing the SD card using different operating
systems, see the `Appendix: Writing the SD card image
<appendix.html#writing-the-sd-card-image>`_.
   
Board Setup
--------------

   .. image:: images/pynqz1_setup.jpg
      :align: center

1. Set the *boot* jumper (labelled JP4 on the board) to the **SD** position by
   placing the jumper over the top two pins of JP4 as shown in the image.  (This
   sets the board to boot from the Micro-SD card)
   
2. To power the PYNQ-Z1 from the micro USB cable, set the *power* jumper (JP5)
   to the **USB** position by placing the jumper over the top two pins of JP5 as
   shown in the image. (You can also power the board from an external 12V power
   regulator by setting the jumper to **REG**.)
   
3. Insert the **Micro SD** card loaded with the PYNQ-Z1 image into the
   board. (The Micro SD slot is underneath the board)
  
4. Connect the USB cable to your PC/Laptop, and to the **PROG/UART** (J14) on
   the board
   
5. Connect the Ethernet cable into your board and see the step below for
   connecting to a computer or network

6. The last step is to power on the board. You should follow the steps below to
   connect to the board before powering on.

Ethernet Setup
--------------

You can connect the Ethernet port of the PYNQ-Z1 Ethernet in the following ways:

* To a router or switch on the same network as your computer

* Directly to an Ethernet port on your computer

If available, you should connect your board to a network with Ethernet
access. This will allow you to update your board and install new packages.

Connect to a Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you connect to a network with a DHCP server, your board will automatically
get an IP address. You must make sure you have permission to connect a device to
your network, otherwise the board may not connect properly.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Router/Network switch (DHCP)                                        |
+=====================================================================+
| 1. Connect to Ethernet port on router/switch                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. Browse to http://pynq:9090                                       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. Optional: Change hostname                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. Optional: Configure proxy                                        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Connect directly to your computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to have an Ethernet port available on your computer, and you will
need to have permissions to configure your network interface. With a direct
connection, you will be able to use PYNQ, but unless you can bridge the Ethernet
connection to the board to an Internet connection on your computer, your board
will not have Internet access. You will be unable to update or load new packages
without Internet access.

+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Direct Connection to your computer (Static IP)         |
+========================================================+
| 1. Configure your computer with a Static IP\*          |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. Connect directly to your computer's Ethernet port   |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. Browse to  http://192.168.2.99:9090                 |
+--------------------------------------------------------+

\* See `Appendix: Assign your PC/Laptop a static IP address
<appendix.html#assign-your-laptop-pc-a-static-ip-address>`_

Turning On the PYNQ-Z1
----------------------

As indicated in step 6 in the diagram above, slide the power switch to the *ON*
position to *Turn On* the board. A *Red LED* will come on immediately to confirm
that the board is powered on.  After a few seconds, a *Yellow/Green LED*
(LD12/DONE) will light up to show that the ZynqÂ® device is operational.

After about 30 seconds you should see two blue LEDs and four yellow/green flash
simultaneously.  The blue LEDS will then go off while the yellow/green LEDS
remain on.  At this point the system is now booted and ready for use.
  
Connecting to Jupyter Notebooks
===============================

* Open a web browser and go to `http://pynq:9090 <http://pynq:9090>`_ (network)
* `http://192.168.2.99:9090 <http://192.168.2.99:9090>`_ (direct connection) The
* username is **xilinx** and the password is also **xilinx**

.. image:: images/portal_homepage.jpg
    :height: 600px
    :scale: 75%
    :align: center


The default hostname is **pynq** and the default static IP address is
``192.168.2.99``. If you changed the hostname or static IP of the board, you
will need to change the address you browse to.

The first time you connect, it may take a few seconds for your computer to
resolve the hostname/IP address.

Example Notebooks
-----------------

A Jupyter notebook can be saved as html webpages. Some of this documentation has
been generated directly from Jupyter notebooks.

You can view the documentation as a webpage, or if you have a board running
PYNQ, you can view and run the notebook documentation interactively. The
documentation available as notebooks can be found in the *Getting_Started*
folder in the Jupyter home area.
 
.. image:: images/getting_started_notebooks.jpg
    :height: 600px
    :scale: 75%
    :align: center


There are also a number of example notebooks available showing how to use
various peripherals with the board.

.. image:: images/example_notebooks.jpg
    :height: 600px
    :scale: 75%
    :align: center

The example notebooks have been divided into categories

    * common: examples that are not overlay specific
    * base: related to the base overlay for the current board
    * logictools: related to the logictools overlay

When you open a notebook and make any changes, or execute cells, the notebook
document will be modified. It is recommended that you "Save a copy" when you
open a new notebook. If you want to restore the original versions, you can
download all the example notebooks from `GitHub
<https://www.github.com/xilinx/pynq>`_ .

Accessing Files on The Board
----------------------------

`Samba <https://www.samba.org/>`_, a file sharing service, is running on the
board. This allws you to access the Pynq home area as a network drive, to
transfer files to and from the board.

To access the Pynq home area in Windows Explorer, navigate to:

``\\pynq\xilinx``

or 

``\\192.168.2.99\xilinx``

To access the home area in Linux type: 

``smb://pynq/xilinx`` 

or 

``smb://192.168.2.99/xilinx``

Remember to change the hostname or IP address to match your board.

The Samba username:password is ``xilinx:xilinx``

Configuring PYNQ
================

Changing the Hostname
---------------------

If you are on a network where other pynq boards may be connected, you should
change your hostname immediately. This is a common requirement in a work or
university environment. You can change the hostname from a terminal. You can use
the USB cable to connect a terminal. A terminal is also available in the Jupyter
environment and can be used from an internet browser.

To access the Jupyter terminal, in the Jupyter portal home area, select **New >>
Terminal**.

.. image:: images/dashboard_files_tab_new.JPG
    :height: 300px
    :align: center
       
This will open a terminal inside the browser as root.

Use the preloaded pynq_hostname.sh script to change your board's hostname.

.. code-block:: console
    
    pynq_hostname.sh <NEW HOSTNAME>

The board must be restarted for the changes to be applied.

.. code-block:: console
    
    shutdown -r now

Note that as you are logged in as root, sudo is not required. If you connect a
terminal from the USB connection, you will be logged in as the *xilinx* user and
sudo must be added to these commands.

When the board reboots, reconnect using the new hostname. 

If you can't connect to your board, see the step below to open a terminal using
the micro USB cable.

Getting a USB Serial Terminal
-----------------------------

If you can't access the terminal from Jupyter, you can connect the micro-USB
cable from your computer to the board and open a terminal. You can use the
terminal to check the network connection of the board. You will need to have
terminal emulator software installed on your computer. `PuTTY
<http://www.putty.org/>`_ is one application that can be used, and is available
for free on Windows. To open a terminal, you will need to know the COM port for
the board.

On Windows, you can find this in the Windows *Device Manager* in the control panel. 
    
    * Open the Device Manager, expand *Ports*
    * Find the COM port for the *USB Serial Port*.  e.g. COM5

Once you have the COM port, open PuTTY and use the following settings:
    
    * Select serial
    * Enter the COM port number
    * Enter the baud rate 
    * Click *Open*

Hit *Enter* in the terminal window to make sure you can see the command prompt:

.. code-block:: console
    
    xilinnx@pynq:/home/xilinx#


Full terminal Settings:
    
    * 115200 baud
    * 8 data bits
    * 1 stop bit
    * No Parity
    * No Flow Control

You can then run the same commands listed above to change the hostname, or configure a proxy. 

You can also check the hostname of the board by running the *hostname* command:

.. code-block:: console
    
    hostname

You can also check the IP address of the board using *ifconfig*:

.. code-block:: console
    
    ifconfig

Configure Proxy Settings
------------------------

If your board is connected to a network that uses a proxy, you need to set the
proxy variables on the board. Open a terminal as above and enter the following
where you should replace "my_http_proxy:8080" and "my_https_proxy:8080" with
your settings.

.. code-block:: console
    
    set http_proxy=my_http_proxy:8080
    set https_proxy=my_https_proxy:8080
