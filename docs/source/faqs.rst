Connecting to the board
*******************************

I can't connect to my board 
=============================================
  
1. Check the board is powered on (Red LED LD13) and that the bitstream has been loaded (Green "DONE" LED LD12)

2. Your board and PC/laptop must be on the same network, or have a direct network connection. Check that you can *ping* the board (hostname, or IP address) from a command prompt or terminal on your host PC
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
      >ping pynq

or 

   .. code-block:: console
   
      >ping 192.168.2.99
      
   (The default IP address of the board is : 192.168.2.99)
   
3. Log on to the board through a terminal, and check the system is running. i.e. that the Linux shell is accessible. See below for details on logging on with a terminal.

4. From a terminal, check you can ping the board from your host PC, and also ping your host PC from the board

   If you can't ping the board, or the host PC, check your network settings. 
         
   * You must ensure board your PC and board are connected to the same network, and have IP addresses in the same range. If your network cables is connected directly to your PC/laptop and board, you may need to set a static IP address for your PC/laptop manually. See the  `Appendix: Assign your PC/Laptop a static ip address <appendix.html#assign-your-laptop-pc-a-static-ip-address>`_
         
   * If you have a proxy setup, you may need to add a rule to bypass the board hostname/ip address. 
      
   * If you are using a docking station, when your laptop is docked, the Ethernet port on the PC may be disabled.  
   
My board is not powering on (No Red LED)
==========================================
The board can be powered by USB cable, or power adapter (7 - 15V V 2.1mm centre-positive barrel jack). Make sure Jumper JP5 is set to USB or REG (for power adapter). If powering the board via USB, make sure the USB port is fully powered. Laptops in low power mode may reduce the available power to a USB port. 

The bitstream is not loading (No Green LED)
============================================ 
* Check the Micro-SD card is inserted correctly (the socket is spring loaded, so push it in until you feel it click into place). 
* Check jumper JP4 is set to SD (board boots from Micro SD card).
* Connect a terminal and verify that the Linux boot starts.

If the Linux boot does not start, or fails, you may need to flash the Micro SD card with the PYNQ-Z1 image. 

The hostname of the board is not resolving/not found
=====================================================

It may take the hostname (pynq) some time to resolve on your network. If you know the IP address of the board, it may be faster to use the IP address to navigate to the Jupyter portal instead of the hostname. 

e.g. In your browser, go to:

   .. code-block:: console
   
      http://192.168.2.99:9090

You need to know the IP address of the board first. You can find the IP by connecting a terminal to the board. You can run `ifconfig` in the Linux shell on the board to check the network settings. Check the settings for *eth0* and look for an IP address. 

I don't have an Ethernet port on my PC/Laptop
==================================================
If you don't have an Ethernet port, you can get a USB to Ethernet adapter. 

If you have a wireless router with Ethernet ports (LAN), you can connect your PYNQ-Z1 board to an Ethernet port on your router, and connect to it from your PC using WiFi. (You may need to change settings on your Router to enable the Wireless network to communicate with your LAN - check your equipment documentation for details.)
   
You can also connect a WiFi dongle to the board, and set up the board to connect to the wireless network. Your host PC can then connect to the same wireless network to connect to the board. 

How do I setup my computer to connect to the board?
=====================================================

If you are connecting your board to your network (i.e. you have plugged the Ethernet cable into the board, and the other end into a network switch, or home router), then you should not need to setup anything on your computer. Usually, both your computer, and board will be assigned an IP address automatically, and they will be able to communicate with each other. 

If you connect your board directly to your computer with an ethernet cable, then you need to make sure that they have IP addresses in the same range. The board will assign itself a static IP address (by default 192.168.2.99), and you will need to assign a static IP address in the same range to the computer.  This allows your computer and board to communicate to each other over the Ethernet cable. 

See the  `Appendix: Assign your PC/Laptop a static ip address <appendix.html#assign-your-laptop-pc-a-static-ip-address>`_

I can't connect to the Jupyter portal
=======================================
My Board is powered on, and I see the Red and Green LEDs, but I can't connect to the Jupyter Portal, or see the Samba shared drive:

By default, the board has DHCP enabled. If you plug the board into a home router, or network switch connected to your network, it should be allocated an IP address automatically. If not, it should fall back to a static IP address of `192.168.2.99`
   
If you plug the Ethernet cable directly to your computer, you will need to configure your network card to have an IP in the same address range. e.g. `192.168.2.1`
   
My board is connected, and I have verified the IP addresses on the board and my network interface, but I cannot connect to the board.

VPN
=====
If your PC/laptop is connected to a VPN, and your board is not on the same VPN network, this will block access to local IP addresses. You need to disable the VPN, or set it to bypass the board address.

Proxy
==========
If your board is connected to a network that uses a proxy, you need to set the proxy variables on the board

   .. code-block:: console
   
      set http_proxy=my_http_proxy:8080
      set https_proxy=my_https_proxy:8080

How do I connect to the board using a terminal?
======================================================
To do this, you need to connect to the board using a terminal.
   
To connect a terminal:
Connect a Micro USB cable to the board and your PC/Laptop, and use a terminal emulator (puTTY, TeraTerm etc) to connect to the board. 
   
   Terminal Settings: 
   
   * 115200 baud
   * 8 data bits
   * 1 stop bit
   * No Parity
   * No Flow Control
   

Once you connect to the board, you can configure the network interface in Linux

How do I modify the board settings?
======================================================
Linux is installed on the board. Connect to the board using a terminal, and change the settings as you would for any other Linux machine.  
   
How do I find the IP address of the board?
======================================================

Connect to the board using a terminal (see above) and type 'hostname -I' to find the IP address for the eth0 Ethernet adapter or the WiFi dongle.
   
How do I set/change the static IP address on the board?
========================================================

The Static IP address is set in ``/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf``  - you can modify the board's static IP here.
   
How do I find my hostname?
======================================================

Connect to the board using a terminal and run ``hostname``
   
How do I change the hostname?
======================================================

If you have multiple boards on the same network, you should give them different host names. 
You can change the hostname by editing the Linux hostname file:

   .. code-block:: console
   
      /etc/hostname
   
What is the user account and password?
======================================================

Username and password for all Linux, jupyter and samba logins are: ``xilinx/xilinx``
   

How do I enable/disable the Jupyter notebook password
======================================================

The Jupyter configuration file can be found at 

   .. code-block:: console
   
      /root/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

You can add or comment out the c.NotebookApp.password to bypass the password authentication when connecting to the Jupyter Portal.

   .. code-block:: console

      c.NotebookApp.password =u'sha1:6c2164fc2b22:ed55ecf07fc0f985ab46561483c0e888e8964ae6'


How do I change the Jupyter notebook password
======================================================
A hashed password is saved in the Jupyter Notebook configuration file. 

   .. code-block:: console

      /root/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

You can create a hashed password using the function `IPython.lib.passwd()`:

   .. code-block:: python
   
      from IPython.lib import passwd
      password = passwd("secret")
      6c2164fc2b22:ed55ecf07fc0f985ab46561483c0e888e8964ae6


You can then add or modify the line in the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file

   .. code-block:: console

      c.NotebookApp.password =u'sha1:6c2164fc2b22:ed55ecf07fc0f985ab46561483c0e888e8964ae6'
