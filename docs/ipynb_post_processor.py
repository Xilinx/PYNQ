"""Script to overcome bug in current nbsphinx-Sphinx flow.

This file is modified on 13 April 2016

Note
----
nbsphinx only seems to recognize Jupyter notebook image references specified 
in "![](images/image.jpeg)" markdown format. 
 
This script post-processes Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files prior to their 
being processed by npsphinx and Sphinx.

1. It removes a markdown reference to an image file WHICH MUST APPEAR AS THE 
LAST LINE IN A GIVEN MARKDOWN CELL.

2. It then inserts a RAW cell with reST annotation which includes a figure 
directive for the image with center alignment.

3. It repeats this for all markdown cells with markdown image references as 
their last line.

4. Finally it rewrites the <.ipynb> as files. The original files will be 
saved in a temporary folder. The new files can then be processed by 
the nbsphinx-Sphinx flow.

It is expected that the script will be run in the docs directory of the Sphinx
project (beside the makefile). The target_dir variable should be set to 
./source for nornmal operation.
