2013.1:
 * Version 4.0
 * Vivado-only core, with no functional changes from version 3.10.c
 * There have been no functional or interface changes to this IP.  The version number has changed to support unique versioning in Vivado starting with 2013.1.

2012.4:
 * Version 3.10.c
 * Fixed issue with missing signal in sensitivity list, only affecting simulation, which can only occur when C_ECC is set, C_ECC_ONOFF_REGISTER is set, and C_INTERCONNECT is not 0

2012.3:
 * Version 3.10.b
 * Fixed issue with error detection and correction not performed when no bus interface used (C_INTERCONNECT = 0)

2012.2:
 * Version 3.10.a
 * Native Vivado release
 * Support for multiple LMB buses
 * Fixed error signalling when a bit-error is detected during a byte/half-word write. Ensure that correctable errors update registers and assert the CE signal on the LMB. Ensure that uncorrectable errors update registers and assert the UE signal on the LMB.
