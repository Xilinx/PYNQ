2015.2.1:
 * Version 5.5 (Rev. 2)
 * No changes

2015.2:
 * Version 5.5 (Rev. 2)
 * No changes

2015.1:
 * Version 5.5 (Rev. 2)
 * Secure/Non-Secure Access configuration Enablement added in general settings
 * DDR training board details were updated with revised scale and correct values
 * Writing to register tpiu Curentsize (0xF8803004) register is removed if trace is disabled
 * Enchancements for easier DS_5 integration. These Include Dynamic Trace pipeline width configuration based on user chioce and Adding keep option for Trace Control and Data registers
 * Added support and functionality for secure and Non-secure

2014.4.1:
 * Version 5.5 (Rev. 1)
 * No changes

2014.4:
 * Version 5.5 (Rev. 1)
 * DDR training board details were updated with revised scale
 * Other bug fixes
 * Reserved bit for DRAM_param_reg3(0xF8006020) updated to '0'

2014.3:
 * Version 5.5
 * The custom time stamp unit(PTP) signals will be exposed to the Programmable Logic(PL), even when the Ethernet is routed through the MIO. For more details, please refer Zynq Technical Reference Manual (UG 585) CH No. 16.4 IEEE 1588 Time Stamping. This change enables additional optional functionality for designs with Ethernet on MIO. No changes are required for existing designs
 * Updated Trace data port width dependency to be based on Trace parameters Port width will display based on user selection
 * Updated the JTAG interface from master to slave mode. Based on Zynq Technical Reference Manual, PS boot mode supports 4 master boot mode and 2 Slave JTAG Boot mode. Prior versions of Zynq PS7 IP had PL JTAG in master mode incorrectly. The JTAG port TDO will have a buffer (OBUFT) instantiated as part of the Processing System7 IP. This change only affects designs which use PL JTAG through EMIO interface. For More details, refer chapter no.6 of Zynq Technical Reference Manual (UG 585) - Boot and Configuration
 * Added range validation for SMC cycle parameters
 * Prior versions of PS7 IP had writes to certain reserved bits of DDR IOB Buffer Control (DDRIOB_DDR_CTRL). These have been fixed to 0x0.
 * Save and Apply Configuration options are added to preset
 * Training board details were updated and computed for revised scale
 * ENET separate pins for reset introduced
 * Asserted in Self Refresh for register dram_param_reg3
 * DRAM_ODT_reg(0xF8006048) is updated with reserved bits of '1'
 * DDRIOB_DDR_CTRL(0xF8000B6C) is updated with VRP/VRN enabled
 * Added Configuration for tpiu Curentsize (0xF8803004) register to ps7_init and ps7_post_config
 * DBG_CLK_CTRL(0xF8000164) register updates when Trace is enabled, Clock source as EMIO for TPIU
