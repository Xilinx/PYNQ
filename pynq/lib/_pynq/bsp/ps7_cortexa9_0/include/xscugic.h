/**

* @file xscugic.h
*
* The generic interrupt controller driver component.
*
* The interrupt controller driver uses the idea of priority for the various
* handlers. Priority is an integer within the range of 1 and 31 inclusive with
* default of 1 being the highest priority interrupt source. The priorities
* of the various sources can be dynamically altered as needed through
* hardware configuration.
*
* The generic interrupt controller supports the following
* features:
*
*   - specific individual interrupt enabling/disabling
*   - specific individual interrupt acknowledging
*   - attaching specific callback function to handle interrupt source
*   - assigning desired priority to interrupt source if default is not
*     acceptable.
*
* Details about connecting the interrupt handler of the driver are contained
* in the source file specific to interrupt processing, xscugic_intr.c.
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works with
* physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
* or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
* satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* <b>Interrupt Vector Tables</b>
*
* The device ID of the interrupt controller device is used by the driver as a
* direct index into the configuration data table. The user should populate the
* vector table with handlers and callbacks at run-time using the
* XScuGic_Connect() and XScuGic_Disconnect() functions.
*
* Each vector table entry corresponds to a device that can generate an
* interrupt. Each entry contains an interrupt handler function and an
* argument to be passed to the handler when an interrupt occurs.  The
* user must use XScuGic_Connect() when the interrupt handler takes an
* argument other than the base address.
*
* <b>Nested Interrupts Processing</b>
*
* Nested interrupts are not supported by this driver.
*
* NOTE:
* The generic interrupt controller is not a part of the snoop control unit
* as indicated by the prefix "scu" in the name of the driver.
* It is an independent module in APU.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a drg  01/19/00 First release
* 1.01a sdm  11/09/11 The XScuGic and XScuGic_Config structures have changed.
*		      The HandlerTable (of type XScuGic_VectorTableEntry) is
*		      moved to XScuGic_Config structure from XScuGic structure.
*
*		      The "Config" entry in XScuGic structure is made as
*		      pointer for better efficiency.
*
*		      A new file named as xscugic_hw.c is now added. It is
*		      to implement low level driver routines without using
*		      any xscugic instance pointer. They are useful when the
*		      user wants to use xscugic through device id or
*		      base address. The driver routines provided are explained
*		      below.
*		      XScuGic_DeviceInitialize that takes device id as
*		      argument and initializes the device (without calling
*		      XScuGic_CfgInitialize).
*		      XScuGic_DeviceInterruptHandler that takes device id
*		      as argument and calls appropriate handlers from the
*		      HandlerTable.
*		      XScuGic_RegisterHandler that registers a new handler
*		      by taking xscugic hardware base address as argument.
*		      LookupConfigByBaseAddress is used to return the
*		      corresponding config structure from XScuGic_ConfigTable
*		      based on the scugic base address passed.
* 1.02a sdm  12/20/11 Removed AckBeforeService from the XScuGic_Config
*		      structure.
* 1.03a srt  02/27/13 Moved Offset calculation macros from *.c and *_hw.c to
*		      *_hw.h
*		      Added APIs
*			- XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()
*			- XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()
*		      (CR 702687)
*			Added support to direct interrupts to the appropriate CPU. Earlier
*			  interrupts were directed to CPU1 (hard coded). Now depending
*			  upon the CPU selected by the user (xparameters.h), interrupts
*			  will be directed to the relevant CPU. This fixes CR 699688.
* 1.04a hk   05/04/13 Assigned EffectiveAddr to CpuBaseAddress in
*			  XScuGic_CfgInitialize. Fix for CR#704400 to remove warnings.
*			  Moved functions XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr and
*             XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr to xscugic_hw.c.
*			  This is fix for CR#705621.
* 1.05a hk   06/26/13 Modified tcl to export external interrupts correctly to
*                     xparameters.h. Fix for CR's 690505, 708928 & 719359.
* 2.0   adk  12/10/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
* 2.1   adk  25/04/14 Fixed the CR:789373 changes are made in the driver tcl file.
*
* </pre>
