*
* XIic is the driver for an IIC master or slave device.
*
* In order to reduce the memory requirements of the driver the driver is
* partitioned such that there are optional parts of the driver.
* Slave, master, and multimaster features are optional such that all these files
* are not required at the same time.
* In order to use the slave and multimaster features of the driver, the user
* must call functions (XIic_SlaveInclude and XIic_MultiMasterInclude)
* to dynamically include the code. These functions may be called at any time.
*
* Two sets of higher level API's are available in the XIic driver that can
* be used for Transmission/Reception in Master mode :
* - XIic_MasterSend()/ XIic_MasterRecv() which is used in normal mode.
* - XIic_DynMasterSend()/ XIic_DynMasterRecv() which is used in Dynamic mode.
*
* Similarly two sets of lower level API's are available in XIic driver that
* can be used for Transmission/Reception in Master mode:
* - XIic_Send()/ XIic_Recv() which is used in normal mode
* - XIic_DynSend()/ XIic_DynRecv() which is used in Dynamic mode.
*
* The user should use a single set of APIs as per his requirement and
* should not intermix them.
*
* All the driver APIs can be used for read, write and  combined mode of
* operations on the IIC bus.
*
* In the normal mode IIC support both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing, and in
* the dynamic mode support only 7-bit addressing.
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The XIic_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
* build properties.
*
* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
* by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in one
* of the following ways:
*
*   - XIic_Initialize() - The driver looks up its own
*     configuration structure created by the tool-chain based on an ID provided
*     by the tool-chain.
*
*   - XIic_CfgInitialize() - The driver uses a configuration structure provided
*     by the caller. If running in a system with address translation, the
*     provided virtual memory base address replaces the physical address present
*     in the configuration structure.
*
* <b>General Purpose Output</b>
* The IIC hardware provides a General Purpose Output Register that allows the
* user to connect general purpose outputs to devices, such as a write protect,
* for an EEPROM. This register is parameterizable in the hardware such that
* there could be zero bits in this register and in this case it will cause
* a bus error if read or written.
*
* <b>Bus Throttling</b>
*
* The IIC hardware provides bus throttling which allows either the device, as
* either a master or a slave, to stop the clock on the IIC bus. This feature
* allows the software to perform the appropriate processing for each interrupt
* without an unreasonable response restriction.  With this design, it is
* important for the user to understand the implications of bus throttling.
*
* <b>Repeated Start</b>
*
* An application can send multiple messages, as a master, to a slave device
* and re-acquire the IIC bus each time a message is sent. The repeated start
* option allows the application to send multiple messages without re-acquiring
* the IIC bus for each message. The transactions involving repeated start
* are also called combined transfers if there is Read and Write in the
* same transaction.
*
* The repeated start feature works with all the API's in XIic driver.
*
* The Repeated Start feature also could cause the application to lock up, or
* monopolize the IIC bus, should repeated start option be enabled and sequences
* of messages never end(periodic data collection).
* Also when repeated start is not disable before the last master message is
* sent or received, will leave the bus captive to the master, but unused.
*
* <b>Addressing</b>
*
* The IIC hardware is parameterized such that it can be built for 7 or 10
* bit addresses. The driver provides the ability to control which address
* size is sent in messages as a master to a slave device.  The address size
* which the hardware responds to as a slave is parameterized as 7 or 10 bits
* but fixed by the hardware build.
*
* Addresses are represented as hex values with no adjustment for the data
* direction bit as the software manages address bit placement. This is
* especially important as the bit placement is not handled the same depending
* on which options are used such as repeated start and 7 vs 10 bit addessing.
*
* <b>Data Rates</b>
*
* The IIC hardware is parameterized such that it can be built to support
* data rates from DC to 400KBit. The frequency of the interrupts which
* occur is proportional to the data rate.
*
* <b>Polled Mode Operation</b>
*
* This driver does not provide a polled mode of operation primarily because
* polled mode which is non-blocking is difficult with the amount of
* interaction with the hardware that is necessary.
*
* <b>Interrupts</b>
*
* The device has many interrupts which allow IIC data transactions as well
* as bus status processing to occur.
*
* The interrupts are divided into two types, data and status. Data interrupts
* indicate data has been received or transmitted while the status interrupts
* indicate the status of the IIC bus. Some of the interrupts, such as Not
* Addressed As Slave and Bus Not Busy, are only used when these specific
* events must be recognized as opposed to being enabled at all times.
*
* Many of the interrupts are not a single event in that they are continuously
* present such that they must be disabled after recognition or when undesired.
* Some of these interrupts, which are data related, may be acknowledged by the
* software by reading or writing data to the appropriate register, or must
* be disabled. The following interrupts can be continuous rather than single
* events.
*   - Data Transmit Register Empty/Transmit FIFO Empty
*   - Data Receive Register Full/Receive FIFO
*   - Transmit FIFO Half Empty
*   - Bus Not Busy
*   - Addressed As Slave
*   - Not Addressed As Slave
*
* The following interrupts are not passed directly to the application thru the
* status callback.  These are only used internally for the driver processing
* and may result in the receive and send handlers being called to indicate
* completion of an operation.  The following interrupts are data related
* rather than status.
*   - Data Transmit Register Empty/Transmit FIFO Empty
*   - Data Receive Register Full/Receive FIFO
*   - Transmit FIFO Half Empty
*   - Slave Transmit Complete
*
* <b>Interrupt To Event Mapping</b>
*
* The following table provides a mapping of the interrupts to the events which
* are passed to the status handler and the intended role (master or slave) for
* the event. Some interrupts can cause multiple events which are combined
* together into a single status event such as XII_MASTER_WRITE_EVENT and
* XII_GENERAL_CALL_EVENT
* <pre>
* Interrupt                         Event(s)                      Role
*
* Arbitration Lost Interrupt        XII_ARB_LOST_EVENT            Master
* Transmit Error                    XII_SLAVE_NO_ACK_EVENT        Master
* IIC Bus Not Busy                  XII_BUS_NOT_BUSY_EVENT        Master
* Addressed As Slave                XII_MASTER_READ_EVENT,        Slave
*                                   XII_MASTER_WRITE_EVENT,       Slave
*                                   XII_GENERAL_CALL_EVENT        Slave
* </pre>
* <b>Not Addressed As Slave Interrupt</b>
*
* The Not Addressed As Slave interrupt is not passed directly to the
* application thru the status callback.  It is used to determine the end of
* a message being received by a slave when there was no stop condition
* (repeated start).  It will cause the receive handler to be called to
* indicate completion of the operation.
*
* <b>RTOS Independence</b>
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works
* with physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management,
* threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must
* be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
