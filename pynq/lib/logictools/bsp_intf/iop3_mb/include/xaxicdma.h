 *
 * This is the driver API for the AXI CDMA engine.
 *
 * For a full description of the features of the AXI CDMA engine, please
 * refer to the hardware specification. This driver supports the following
 * features:
 *
 *   - Simple DMA transfer
 *   - Scatter gather (SG) DMA transfer
 *   - Interrupt for error or completion of transfers
 *   - For SG DMA transfer:
 *      - Programmable interrupt coalescing
 *      - Programmable delay timer counter
 *      - Managing the buffer descriptors (BDs)
 *
 * <b>Two Hardware Building Modes</b>
 *
 * The hardware can be built in two modes:
 *
 *  - <b>Simple only mode</b>, in this mode, only simple transfers are
 *    supported by the hardware. The functionality is similar to the XPS
 *    Central DMA, however, the driver API to do the transfer is slightly
 *    different.
 *
 *  - <b>Hybrid mode</b>, in this mode, the hardware supports both the simple
 *  transfer and the SG transfer. However, only one kind of transfer can be
 *  active at a time. If an SG transfer is ongoing in the hardware, a
 *  submission of a simple transfer fails. If a simple transfer is ongoing in
 *  the hardware, a submission of an SG transfer is successful, however the
 *  SG transfer will not start until the simple transfer is done.
 *
 * <b>Transactions</b>
 *
 * The hardware supports two types of transfers, the simple DMA transfer and
 * the scatter gather (SG) DMA transfer.
 *
 * A simple DMA transfer only needs source buffer address, destination buffer
 * address and transfer length to do a DMA transfer. Only one transfer can be
 * submitted to the hardware at a time.
 *
 * A SG DMA transfer requires setting up a buffer descriptor (BD), which keeps
 * the transfer information, including source buffer address, destination
 * buffer address, and transfer length. The hardware updates the BD for the
 * completion status of the transfer. BDs that are connected to each other can
 * be submitted to the hardware at once, therefore, the SG DMA transfer has
 * better performance when the application is doing multiple transfers each
 * time.
 *
 * <b>Callback Function</b>
 *
 * Each transfer, for which the application cares about its completion, should
 * provide with the driver its callback function. The signature of the
 * callback function is as the following:
 *
 * void XAxiCdma_CallBackFn(void *CallBackRef, u32 IrqMask, int *NumPtr);
 *
 * Where the CallBackRef is a reference pointer that the application passes to
 * the driver along with the callback function. The driver passes IrqMask to
 * the application when it calls this callback. The NumPtr is only used in SG
 * mode to track how many BDs still left for this callback function.
 *
 * The callback function is set upon transfer submission:
 *
 *  - Simple transfer callback function setup:
 *
 *   <b>Only set the callback function if in interrupt mode.</b>
 *
 *   For simple transfers, the callback function along with the callback
 *   reference pointer is passed to the driver through the submission of the
 *   simple transfer:
 *
 *        XAxiCdma_SimpleTransfer(...)
 *
 *  - SG transfer callback function setup:
 *   For SG transfers, the callback function and the callback reference
 *   pointer are set through the transfer submission call:
 *
 *        XAxiCdma_BdRingToHw(...)
 *
 * <b>Simple Transfers</b>
 *
 * For an application that only does one DMA transfer at a time, and the DMA
 * engine is exclusively used by this application, simple DMA transfer is
 * sufficient.
 *
 * Using the simple DMA transfer has the advantage of ease of use comparing to
 * SG DMA transfer. For an individual DMA transfer, simple DMA transfer is
 * also faster because of simplicity in software and hardware.
 *
 * <b>Scatter Gather (SG) Transfers</b>
 *
 * For an application that has multiple DMA transfers sometimes, or the DMA
 * engine is shared by multiple applications, using SG DMA transfer yields
 * better performance over all applications.
 *
 * The SG DMA transfer provides queuing of multiple transfers, therefore, it
 * provides better performance because the hardware can continuously work on
 * all submitted transfers without software intervention.
 *
 * The down side of using the SG DMA transfer is that you have to manage the
 * memory for the buffer descriptors (BD), and setup BDs for the transfers.
 *
 * <b>Interrupts</b>
 *
 * The driver handles the interrupts.
 *
 * The completion of a transfer, that has a callback function associated with,
 * will trigger the driver to call the callback function. The IrqMask that is
 * passed through the callback function notifies the application about the
 * completion status of the transfer.
 *
 * <b>Interrupt Coalescing for SG Transfers</b>
 *
 * For SG transfers, the application can program the interrupt coalescing
 * threshold to reduce the frequency of interrupts. If the number of transfers
 * does not match well with the interrupt coalescing threshold, the completion
 * of the last transfer will not trigger the completion interrupt. However,
 * after the specified delay count time, the delay interrupt will fire.
 *
 * By default, the interrupt threshold for the hardware is one, which is one
 * interrupt per BD completion.
 *
 * <b>Delay Interrupt for SG Transfers</b>
 *
 * Delay interrupt is to signal the application about inactivity of transfers.
 * If the delay interrupt is enabled, the delay timer starts counting down
 * once a transfer has started. If the interval between transfers is longer
 * than the delay counter, the delay interrupt is fired.
 *
 * By default, the delay counter is zero, which means the delay interrupt is
 * disabled. To enable delay interrupt, the delay interrupt enable bit must be
 * set and the delay counter must be set to a value between 1 to 255.
 *
 * <b>BD management for SG DMA Transfers </b>
 *
 * BD is shared by the software and the hardware. To use BD for SG DMA
 * transfers, the application needs to use the driver API to do the following:
 *
 * - Setup the BD ring:
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdRingCreate(...)
 *
 *   Note that the memory for the BD ring is allocated and is later
 *   de-allocated by the application.
 *
 * - Request BD from the BD ring, more than one BDs can be requested at once:
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdRingAlloc(...)
 *
 * - Prepare BDs for the transfer, one BD at a time:
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdSetSrcBufAddr(...)
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdSetDstBufAddr(...)
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdSetLength(...)
 *
 * - Submit all prepared BDs to the hardware:
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdRingToHw(...)
 *
 * - Upon transfer completion, the application can request completed BDs from
 *   the hardware:
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdRingFromHw(...)
 *
 * - After the application has finished using the BDs, it should free the
 *   BDs back to the free pool:
 *      - XAxiCdma_BdRingFree(...)
 *
 * The driver also provides API functions to get the status of a completed
 * BD, along with get functions for other fields in the BD.
 *
 * The following two diagrams show the correct flow of BDs:
 *
 * The first diagram shows a complete cycle for BDs, starting from
 * requesting the BDs to freeing the BDs.
 * <pre>
 *
 *         XAxiCdma_BdRingAlloc()                   XAxiCdma_BdRingToHw()
 * Free ------------------------> Pre-process ----------------------> Hardware
 *                                                                    |
 *  /|\                                                               |
 *   |   XAxiCdma_BdRingFree()                XAxiCdma_BdRingFromHw() |
 *   +--------------------------- Post-process <----------------------+
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * The second diagram shows when a DMA transfer is to be cancelled before
 * enqueuing to the hardware, application can return the requested BDs to the
 * free group using XAxiCdma_BdRingUnAlloc().
 * <pre>
 *
 *         XAxiCdma_BdRingUnAlloc()
 *   Free <----------------------- Pre-process
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Physical/Virtual Addresses</b>
 *
 * Addresses for the transfer buffers are physical addresses.
 *
 * For SG transfers, the next BD pointer in a BD is also a physical address.
 *
 * However, application's reference to a BD and to the transfer buffers are
 * through virtual addresses.
 *
 * The application is responsible to translate the virtual addresses of its
 * transfer buffers to physical addresses before handing them to the driver.
 *
 * For systems where MMU is not used, or MMU is a direct mapping, then the
 * physical address and the virtual address are the same.
 *
 * <b>Cache Coherency</b>
 *
 * To prevent cache and memory inconsistency:
 *  - Flush the transmit buffer range before the transfer
 *  - Invalidate the receive buffer range before passing it to the hardware and
 *    before passing it to the application
 *
 * For SG transfers:
 *  - Flush the BDs once the preparation setup is done
 *  - Invalidate the memory region for BDs when BDs are retrieved from the
 *    hardware.
 *
 * <b>BD alignment for SG Transfers</b>
 *
 * The hardware has requirement for the minimum alignment of the BDs,
 * XAXICDMA_BD_MINIMUM_ALIGNMENT. It is OK to have an alignment larger than the
 * required minimum alignment, however, it must be multiple of the minimum
 * alignment. The alignment is passed into XAxiCdma_BdRingCreate().
 *
 * <b>Error Handling</b>
 *
 * The hardware halts upon all error conditions. The driver will reset the
 * hardware once the error occurs.
 *
 * The IrqMask argument in the callback function notifies the application about
 * error conditions for the transfer.
 *
 * <b>Mutual Exclusion</b>
 *
 * The driver does not provide mutual exclusion mechanisms, it is up to the
 * upper layer to handle this.
 *
 * <b>Hardware Defaults & Exclusive Use</b>
 *
 * The hardware is in the following condition on start or after a reset:
 *
 * - All interrupts are disabled.
 * - The engine is in simple mode.
 * - Interrupt coalescing counter is one.
 * - Delay counter is 0.
 *
 * The driver has exclusive use of the hardware registers and BDs. Accessing
 * the hardware registers or the BDs should always go through the driver API
 * functions.
 *
 * <b>Hardware Features That User Should Be Aware of</b>
 *
 * For performance reasons, the driver does not check the submission of
 * transfers during run time. It is the user's responsibility to submit
 * approrpiate transfers to the hardware. The following hardware features
 * should be considerred when submitting a transfer:
 *
 *  . Whether the hardware supports unaligned transfers, reflected through
 * C_INCLUDE_DRE in system.mhs file. Submitting unaligned transfers while the
 * hardware does not support it, causes errors upon transfer submission.
 * Aligned transfer is in respect to word length, and word length is defined
 * through the building parameter XPAR_AXI_CDMA_0_M_AXI_DATA_WIDTH.
 *
 *  . Memory range of the transfer addresses. Transfer data to executable
 * memory can crash the system.
 *
 *  . Lite mode. To save hardware resources (drastically), you may select
 * "lite" mode build of the hardware. However, with lite mode, the following
 * features are _not_ supported:
 *    - Cross page boundary transfer. Each transfer must be restrictly inside
 *      one page; otherwise, slave error occurs.
 *    - Unaligned transfer.
 *    - Data width larger than 64 bit
 *    - Maximum transfer length each time is limited to data_width * burst_len
 *
 * <pre>
 * MODIFICATION HISTORY:
 *
 *  . Updated the debug print on type casting to avoid warnings on u32. Cast
 *    u32 to (unsigned int) to use the %x format.
