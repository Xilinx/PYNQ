class PynqBuffer(np.ndarray):
    """A subclass of numpy.ndarray which is allocated using
    physically contiguous memory for use with DMA engines and
    hardware accelerators. As physically contiguous memory is a
    limited resource it is strongly recommended to free the
    underlying buffer with `close` when the buffer is no longer
    needed. Alternatively a `with` statement can be used to
    automatically free the memory at the end of the scope.

    This class should not be constructed directly and instead
    created using `pynq.allocate()`.
