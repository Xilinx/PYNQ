    "This notebook provides a simple example for using asyncio I/O to interact asynchronously with multiple input devices. A task is created for each input device and coroutines used to process the results. To demonstrate, we recreate the flashing LEDs example in the getting started notebook but using interrupts to avoid polling the GPIO devices. The aim is have holding a button result in the corresponding LED flashing."
